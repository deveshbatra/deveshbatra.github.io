**Questions that I need answers to**

1. Should we choose a generative or a discriminative model?
*Notes:*
- LSTM for handwriting was generative, but if we need to do handwriting recognition, that needs to be a discriminative model.

2. What is the relation between the number of layers, number of nodes in a layer and the number of parameters in the model?
*Notes:*
- The answer for 2 hidden layers in LSTM for 512 nodes is 3.5 :\|
